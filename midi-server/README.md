## The Good:

* SysEx-Addresses were double-checked
* Extensible to also support other devices than the INTEGRA-7
* May access random addresses without dumping everything

## The Bad:

* Read-only (for now)
* Rather slow (for now)
* There's no way of determining the allowed value-ranges (apart from reading the documentation)
* Early stages, API likely to change
